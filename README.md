🔧 How It Works

- The progress bar is made of two layers:

- A gray background bar that shows the total range.

- A green animated bar (progress-bar-run) that grows with each completed step.

- Each step is represented by a circular icon:

- Initially shows an ❌ icon (fa-xmark)

- Changes to ✅ (fa-check) when completed

- The Next and Previous buttons:

- Add or remove the .checked class

- Update icons and show/hide labels dynamically

- Adjust the progress bar width based on the current step
